        <h1>Privacy Policy for StreamScout</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 23, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to StreamScout. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and protected when you use our mobile application ("the App").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you use StreamScout, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you choose to create an account, we collect your email address and authentication credentials via Firebase Authentication (including Google Sign-In and Apple Sign-In).</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect data about your interactions with the App, such as your watch history, watchlists, ratings, and preferences. This data is stored securely using Google Cloud Firestore.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics and Crash Data:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymous diagnostic and usage data to improve the App's performance and stability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide, maintain, and improve the personalized features of the App.</li>
            <li>To synchronize your watch history and preferences across your devices securely.</li>
            <li>To analyze usage patterns and fix bugs to improve the overall user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is securely stored on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) servers. We implement industry-standard security measures, including Firebase App Check, to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information. Our application utilizes a secure Application Programming Interface (API) proxy to protect third-party API keys (such as TMDB and OMDb) and ensure zero secrets are stored directly on your device.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App utilizes the following third-party services that may collect information used to identify you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services & Firebase</a> (Authentication, Analytics, Crashlytics, Firestore)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple</a> (Sign-In with Apple)</li>
            <li><strong>TMDB and OMDb:</strong> Used for fetching movie and TV show metadata. No personal user data is transmitted to these services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your region, you may have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your account and associated data. You can delete your account directly from the App's settings or by contacting us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
